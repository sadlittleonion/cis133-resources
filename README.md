# cis133-resources

https://www.w3schools.com/html/
This was my main resource for html back in high school. 
It might be a little cramped, but it's my ol' reliable for when it comes to referencing and using html elements.
With lists full of elements, how to use them and interactive examples of using them, it should serve as a good guide going forward.

https://webplatform.github.io/docs/css/
Found after some light googling. 
It has several documents for working with css, every element and what it does, and learning how to actually work with it if you have no experience.
I get the feeling I'll be having to reference this quite a bit in these next few weeks.
